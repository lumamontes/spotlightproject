This is a web application requested by the artist Luana GÃ³es, designed to create a platform where she can interview fellow artists/friends! The website features a simple landing page, about page, and contact page, all managed through Contentful as the CMS, and built with Astro. Each interview has its own dedicated page, featuring a Zine with the interview content created by Luana. The Zines are displayed using FlipHTML5.
